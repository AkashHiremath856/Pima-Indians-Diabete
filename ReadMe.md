<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The Pima Indians are a Native American tribe that primarily resides in Arizona, United States, and Sonora, Mexico. The Pima Indians have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, which has been extensively studied over the years.

Research on the Pima Indians has shown that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is approximately five times higher in this population compared to the general US population. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the high prevalence of diabetes in this population, including genetic factors, lifestyle factors (such as diet and physical activity), and environmental factors.

Early-stage diabetes risk prediction is the process of identifying individuals who are at a higher risk of developing diabetes before the onset of the disease. This is important because early identification and intervention can significantly reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and blindness.

There are several risk factors that can be used to predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes, including age, family history, obesity, physical inactivity, and certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. In addition, blood tests can also be used to identify individuals who may have elevated blood sugar levels and are at risk of developing diabetes.

Diabetes analysis using machine learning (ML) involves using data mining techniques to extract insights and patterns from diabetes-related datasets. These insights can help predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes, identify the factors that contribute to diabetes, and develop strategies to prevent or manage diabetes
